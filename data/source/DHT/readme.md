**Digital Health Technology (DHT)**

The DHT sub-team is creating synthetic data for the 360i LZZT amendment.

The file **"DHT 360i - Physical Activity - Step Count - activity daily.csv"** provides activity (step count) for 2 subjects.

This data was reviewed and approved; subsequently, the DHT sub-team will provide additional activity data for 30-50 more subjects.

It is expected that they will also be able to provide Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM) data.
