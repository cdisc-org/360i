# Digital Health Technology (DHT)

The DHT sub-team is creating synthetic data for the 360i LZZT amendment.


## "DHT 360i - Physical Activity - Step Count - activity daily.csv"

This provides activity (step count) for 2 subjects.

This data was reviewed and approved; subsequently, the DHT sub-team will provide additional activity data for 30-50 more subjects.

It is expected that they will also be able to provide Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM) data.


## DHT 360i - Glucose Level - CGM - example data 09FEB2024 (2).xlsx

This file provides 7 CGM records for Glucose monitoring.
